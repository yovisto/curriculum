# Curriculum Ontology

This ontology is a formal representation that captures the fundamental concepts and their relationships to one another in the field of curriculum design and implementation. It provides a structured framework for organizing and understanding the key elements that make up a general curriculum. 

Current development is managed via GitHub: https://github.com/yovisto/curriculum

The model is developed based on the structure of the framework curricula for the states of Berlin and Brandenburg in Germany (https://bildungsserver.berlin-brandenburg.de/rlp-online). It is intended to serve as a starting point for formally opening up the structures of other states' curricula and competency frameworks related to curricula. 

This ontology includes concepts that enable a high-level description of a curriculum. Thereby three main components are put in relation to each other: subjects, competencies, learning content. 

The model is inspired by the "Datenmodell zur Abbildung von Lehrpl√§nen" https://dini-ag-kim.github.io/modell_lehrplaene/draft/ and reuses their dini:Curriculum and dini:CurriculumItem. Both extend the SKOS model in that the curriculum itself is to be understood as a subclass of skos:ConceptScheme and the individual components are subordinated to the curriculum as skos:Concept. Likewise, the herewith introduced classes are fitted in as subclasses, and the newly defined object properties inherit from skos:narrow and skos:broader to maintain the SKOS hierarchy.

The ontology imports https://w3id.org/kim/educationalLevel/ for the educational levels wich also links to ISCED levels (International Standard Classification of Education, https://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/international-standard-classification-education-isced). Furthermore type of schools are reused from https://w3id.org/kim/schularten/, school subjects from http://w3id.org/kim/schulfaecher/, graduate levels from https://w3id.org/kim/schulabschluesse .

This is version 1.1.0.
